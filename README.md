**ML based NHL Predictor**

I celebrated 17 birthdays before the Leafs managed to make it to the second round of the Stanley Cup Playoffs. Hopefully it won't take another 17 years for them to make it to the semifinals...

So I designed a ML program to tell me if the Leafs have an actual hope in the Stanley Cup Playoffs, or if I'm just another delusional Leafs fan.

The end goal of the NHL Predictor is to be able to estimate how far a team will make it in the Stanley Cup Playoffs based on their regular season record.

I have already programmed a model that can estimate a team's regular season performance based on factors such as _shots, shooting%, save% PowerPlay/Penalty Kill_ data and more, and I plan on updating the program to predict playoff results in the future.
